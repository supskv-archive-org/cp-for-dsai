    "2. In the KNN lecture notes, it says that there are many methods to calculate the distance between points. So far we have studied euclidean distance, so in this quiz we would like you to explore other distance measurement methods. Please implement **at least one other distance measurement method** and include it in your KNN class which you have implemented in your KNN assignment. (3 points)\n",
